# Movie Recommendation System
## Konsa Movie ?

This is a Movie Recommendation System built using Machine Learning, where users can get movie suggestions based on their preferences. The system utilizes Python, Jupyter, Pandas, Numpy, and Streamlit to provide an interactive web interface for the users.

## Features

- **Content-based recommendation**: Recommends movies based on user input.
- **Interactive interface**: Built with Streamlit to provide an easy-to-use UI.
- **Persistence**: Trained model is saved and loaded using Pickle.

## Tech Stack

- **Jupyter Notebook**: For model development and training.
- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **Pandas & Numpy**: Data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Streamlit**: For creating the web app interface.
- **Pickle**: For saving and loading the trained machine learning model.
- **Requests**: For handling API requests if needed.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (for development)
- Streamlit (for the web interface)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Y4shR4j/konsamovie.git
cd movie-recommendation-system
```

2. Install the required dependencies from `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Requirements

The required libraries are listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

```
streamlit
pickle
requests
```

Make sure to install them before running the project.

## Usage

- To run the project, simply type the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

- The Streamlit app will start, and you can interact with the Movie Recommendation System via a web browser.

## Model

The trained movie recommendation model is saved using `pickle`. It can be loaded and used to generate recommendations based on user input.

## Acknowledgements

- This project uses data and various libraries like Pandas and Numpy to manipulate datasets.
- Thanks to Streamlit for providing an easy way to create web apps.
